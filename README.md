# Arkanoid-mini
a JavaScript game tribute by nightcoder.

PLAY [HERE](https://newnightcoder.github.io/arkanoid-mini/)

This mini browser ballbreaker game was made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript is my very 1st programming project!
I did it as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, a journey ot become a good frontend ;)


So i got introduced to JS thanks to this game that i "built" from scratch, from learning how to draw a simple rectangle to the concept of (game) "states", loop and just the programming logic in general.

More to come in 2020!

Enjoy the game!
